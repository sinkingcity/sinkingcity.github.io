We ask that submissions of fiction and nonfiction be no longer than 7000 words in length. Poetry submissions can include between 3-5 poems (up to 8 pages).  Simultaneous submissions are welcome, if noted.  Please notify us immediately if the work is accepted somewhere else.

        We accept Word and PDF files. In your subject header, please indicate the genre of your submission (Fiction, Poetry, Nonfiction, or Art).
