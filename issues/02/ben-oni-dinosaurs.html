		<div class="poem-content">
			<p>There are birds arising in these flying little dinosaurs
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>There are a hundred birds in each of them
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>They never quite land
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>when they steal </p>
			<p>our last piece of chicken</p>
			<p>though we lay out premium seed </p>
			<p>every night </p>
			<p>& every morning</p>
			<p>on the rooftop of my in-laws</p>
			<p>where my husband & I sleep in a little room</p>
			<p>We watch this happen</p>
			<p>It's like beasts awakening in cave paintings</p>
			<p>It's like coming back to life</p>
			<p>extinct </p>
			<p>without belief</p>
			<p>in anything </p>
			<p>but these flying little dinosaurs</p>
			<p>who seem to know it all </p>
			<p>who don't listen to god </p>
			<p>or natural law</p>
			<p>Without fear they remain </p>
			<p>forever</p>
			<p>not dying</p>
			<p>on a cross </p>
			<p>or overlooking a promise</p>
			<p>land they enter</p>
			<p>wherever chewing through wood</p>
			<p>& rag & screen</p>
			<p>& when the clouds lay low in the afternoon </p>
			<p>from the haze come dragons too</p>
			<p>who descend to undo</p>
			<p>clothespins & nails loose </p>
			<p>At least five little dragons in each </p>
			<p>whose true fire is their speech </p>
			<p>taken from everyone</p>
			<p>& everything</p>
			<p>Muffled laugh track & hawk shrill </p>
			<p>quarreling lovers</p>
			<p>& siren</p>
			<p>church bells </p>
			<p>In august drench until the sky dims </p>
			<p>the whole of hong kong screams out of them</p>
			<p>It taunts & torments & yet</p>
			<p>we never hear them coming</p>
			<p>& they are never of one place</p>
			<p>It never left this earth what they are</p>
			<p>these shitty little dinosaurs</p>
			<p>who won't leave a single grape </p>
			<p>to roll lonely on my plate</p>
			<p>because once they were cockatoos in crates</p>
			<p>crossing the south china sea this</p>
			<p>they have not forgotten </p>
			<p>Every night they escape</p>
			<p>To not not arise from our skylines</p>
			<p>while I hide my most precious things </p>
			<p>as if these things will always be with me</p>
			<p>as if the day will come they do not </p>
			<p>return to the rooftop </p>
			<p>where I'm not holding my breath</p>
			<p>face pressed </p>
			<p>against torn-up mesh
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>What they are this earth never left
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I see the sunrise & sunset within seconds
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>There are
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Hundreds & hundreds of birds arising in every one of them</p>
