		<div class="poem-content">
			<p>In April the potholes could swallow you whole.
			</p><br>
			<p>Pollen squalls across roads and falls on crews that patch them up, flashing lights and orange cones as sure a sign of spring as blowing off work for opening day.
			</p><br>
			<p>In April pitchers blow in their hands and players leave trails of rising breath as they hustle base to base.
			</p><br>
			<p>In April you run through rain and wait for May.
			</p><br>
			<p>Playgrounds swarm with children sprung from apartments, fences lined with smiling moms and dads.
			</p><br>
			<p>In April the asphalt’s cracked and storms that pound the shoreline take away the shapes you know, undertow a grief you trust will sweep you off your feet without a word.
			</p><br>
			<p>You tell yourself it won’t be worse in April. It is. Worse: there’s no explaining why. You lie </p>
			<p>and say it’s the weather. Whether or not it rains the ground is wet.
			</p><br>
			<p>In March the soil starts to thaw. By April soil’s soft enough for seeds.
			</p><br>
			<p>The earth is soft enough for sleep, deep enough to swallow you whole.</p>
