			<p>He had pale green eyes and skin like</p>
			<p>a lizard, cowboyed all his life except</p>
			<p>when he wore a driller's hat, worked</p>
			<p>for a wildcatter in Louisiana he said</p>
			<p>Come a gusher he'd pay you big you</p>
			<p>put some by for dry holes to come</p>
			<p>as they did much more often than not</p>
			<p>like life thataway, let that sink in and</p>
			<p>save for dry holes truer than sin, we</p>
			<p>brought in a gusher, biggest I seen</p>
			<p>at Plaquemines Parish, producing</p>
			<p>now, fifty years later, Hunt bought</p>
			<p>us out, we ate steak for a year, got</p>
			<p>tired of it, spent too much and the</p>
			<p>dry holes come, and the money run</p>
			<p>the other way, so I went west and</p>
			<p>north ended up at the five-oh-one</p>
			<p>that's a brand, and we run beef for</p>
			<p>the war but we ate beans no meat</p>
			<p>for us, so we'd lose one out on the</p>
			<p>range, eat good for awhile but that</p>
			<p>was the exception, like gushers you</p>
			<p>know, sure missed the wildcatter</p>
			<p>he used to say, it's a hard dollar</p>
			<p>boys but a glorious one when the</p>
			<p>earth rumbles and the gold comes</p>
			<p>up, it's in my blood here to stay</p>
			<p>nothing like it no other way to</p>
			<p>get that feeling, the crude erupts</p>
			<p>and covers the sky, you lick your</p>
			<p>lips and taste payday, plug the</p>
			<p>well, tell 'em all to go to hell it's</p>
			<p>freedom and glory and Cadillacs</p>
			<p>first class fare to Vegas and back.</p>
			<p>Pale green eyes look far away</p>
			<p>gone, cut a wide hog in the ass</p>
			<p>them days, in crude we trust the</p>
			<p>bankroll wore a hole in my jeans</p>
			<p>had my face on magazines then</p>
			<p>back to cowboyin,' eatin' beans.</p>
