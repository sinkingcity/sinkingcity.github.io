		<div class="poem-content">
			<p>It begins with a recipe. No, it begins with a phone call.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Aunt Frances calls from the cosmos’ first flicker – </p>
			<p>when animals stood up on hind legs, gawking </p>
			<p>hang-jawed at the stars.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Aunt Frances calls </p>
			<p>and sighs her breath of blood orange </p>
			<p>and sardines into the phone.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Her moon is a blind man’s thumb </p>
			<p>in a forest. Her star, the rusted spur </p>
			<p>of a forgotten Sunday afternoon movie.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Aunt Frances calls, all mush-mouthed and grackled. </p>
			<p>Her punctuation, her parentheses even, </p>
			<p>sinks between the ellipses of her meds.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>After all these years, her mind still can’t drown itself. </p>
			<p>It bobs to the surface: seven hospitalizations </p>
			<p>and thirty-two electroshock treatments in three months.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>As a child, I held my bladder to avoid the uterus-shaped rubber bag </p>
			<p>hanging in her bathroom, its tubes snaking within the folds </p>
			<p>of the mold-splotched shower curtain.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Collapsed sack, moon sickness, hysteria –</p>
			<p>Grandmother heckled. </p>
			<p>Mother rolled her eyes.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Aunt Frances commanded nothing. </p>
			<p>The cockroaches didn’t even scatter </p>
			<p>when she shook a cereal box.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>As steam rises from a boiling pot </p>
			<p>and stuns the window, I too will rise </p>
			<p>and write my aunt’s name against the cold.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I will make her a soup.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I’ll roast sturdy femurs of lamb and mutton with dried rosemary.</p>
			<p>I’ll cover their bones with cold spring water </p>
			<p>and stir clockwise until the broth boils. </p>
			<p>For three days this broth will bubble </p>
			<p>until bones soften to flesh, indentations </p>
			<p>appear to the touch.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I will make her a soup.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Bone marrow will congeal and seep strength </p>
			<p>into her blood. Minerals and amino acids </p>
			<p>will leach into her organism.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Aunt Francis’ mind has circled the cure </p>
			<p>these many decades: </p>
			<p>Lithium, Lexapro, Paxil, Zoloft.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Her Nurse Ratched </p>
			<p>was never movie trivia: </p>
			<p>They’d just tackle and zap us with no anesthesia.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I will make her a soup.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I’ll pour broth and bones </p>
			<p>through cheesecloth </p>
			<p>and squeeze out the good.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>May lymph and liver flush away her woes. </p>
			<p>May thyroid metabolize her testimony:
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>she was the family snow globe, </p>
			<p>a transparent sphere, shaken </p>
			<p>and set down in a faraway corner.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Aunt Frances and I are the only family we have left.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Into the broth, I will lower precious stones: ruby </p>
			<p>to fortify her blood, sapphire to sharpen her mind, </p>
			<p>emerald to honor her birth.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I’ll pick the partridge clean of its ribcage, </p>
			<p>add turnip and rutabaga, </p>
			<p>root bags of cruciferous earth nuzzlers.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>I’ll place gold ducats </p>
			<p>and laurel-stamped doubloons </p>
			<p>at the bottom of her bowl.

			</p>
			<br>
			<p>May this soup’s estuaries swift her away on a pontoon </p>
			<p>of seared sunlight and yellow jonquils.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>As a child, Aunt Frances stared </p>
			<p>at a strand of her hair, pulling it </p>
			<p>like a lost guitar chord snapped into silence.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Baptismal comb raked over her scalp. Liturgical scissors </p>
			<p>snipping kyrie, kyrie. A cascade of water passed over </p>
			<p>Aunt Frances’ head, the knotted and coarse made clean.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>May her spleen Zeitgeist her most humiliating memories:
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>she danced the watusi, </p>
			<p>her yellow-crocheted bikini </p>
			<p>dripping into the snow.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Her cupid lips bellowed operatic </p>
			<p>as she threatened my mother with a steak knife. </p>
			<p>At Christmas she mailed us exquisitely wrapped TV dinners.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Aunt Frances: I want to stuff your pockets with stones </p>
			<p>to see if you float, drown, </p>
			<p>or finally save yourself.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Instead, I will drop stones into your soup.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Soaked and scrubbed, </p>
			<p>an explosion trillions of years ago, blasted </p>
			<p>minuscule craters and unseen ridges
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>into these stones, like you,</p>
			<p>the stuff of stars. </p>
