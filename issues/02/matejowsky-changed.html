		<div class="poem-content">
			<p>Never forget that you are making the </p>
			<p>news now. With superb optimism
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>unfollow everyone on Facebook. </p>
			<p>Only check Twitter twice a week.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Say you’re sorry but not with sarcasm. </p>
			<p>At first it will feel like your head
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>can’t hold it all. There is no harm </p>
			<p>in drawing inspiration from the fowl
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>that come in cold weather. They fall </p>
			<p>from the sky and build nests in the
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>pond’s muddy middle. Keep your head </p>
			<p>underwater all hours. Inhale as many
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>insects and invertebrates as necessary. </p>
			<p>This method is certainly one of the best
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>ways to broadcast your thoughts. Let </p>
			<p>the longleaf pine send them to a satellite.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>Maybe a crane can pull the words from </p>
			<p>her plumage. Enter all your anger on
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>your arms in blacks like ravens’ bills. </p>
			<p>Which ink would look best on Instagram?
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>A great many books have been published </p>
			<p>that will never see the light of day.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>They are resting unread on silent shelves </p>
			<p>in Archer City, Texas. No one needs a
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>narrator like you anymore. </p>
