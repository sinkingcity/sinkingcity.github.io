		<div class="poem-content">
			<p>Inside the garden I could pretend</p>
			<p>I had caught fever, a frenzy of fire</p>
			<br>
			<p>flowers, the ochre ache one expects</p>
			<p>of a tree. I could hear passion, a hum</p>
			<br>
			<p>trapped in the tooth of the wolf</p>
			<p>I watched until she trusted me</p>
			<br>
			<p>with her hunger. I wore her</p>
			<p>hide. I was a revival, an August,</p>
			<br>
			<p>a shattered crescendo of wishing</p>
			<p>for wanting, this ragged waiting</p>
			<br>
			<p>inside of. I choked. The blood</p>
			<p>I expected. I said that I wanted.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I said that I wanted to be flayed</p>
			<p>and carnal, I said that I wanted</p>
			<br>
			<p>to be thrust and shuddered</p>
			<p>under any him willing to be violent</p>
			<br>
			<p>as a god. I said that I wanted to</p>
			<p>understand the point and the hilt</p>
			<br>
			<p>of the sword, I wanted to know</p>
			<p>life gorged and garnet as</p>
			<br>
			<p>the howl inside of every red.</p>
			<p>I tasted fang and honey heavy</p>
			<br>
			<p>as hatred, I tasted tongue, I wanted</p>
			<p>this ragged with waiting, with shame.</p>
