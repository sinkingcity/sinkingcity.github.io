    <h3><span class="poem-title">Under the Threat of Eden</span> by Emma Bolden</h3>

    <div class="poem-content">
      <p>Inside the garden I could pretend</p>
      <p>I had caught fever, a frenzy of fire</p>
      <br>
      <p>flowers, the ochre ache one expects</p>
      <p>of a tree. I could hear passion, a hum</p>
      <br>
      <p>trapped in the tooth of the wolf</p>
      <p>I watched until she trusted me</p>
      <br>
      <p>with her hunger. I wore her</p>
      <p>hide. I was a revival, an August,</p>
      <br>
      <p>a shattered crescendo of wishing</p>
      <p>for wanting, this ragged waiting</p>
      <br>
      <p>inside of. I choked. The blood</p>
      <p>I expected. I said that I wanted.</p>
      <br>
      <p>I said that I wanted to be flayed</p>
      <p>and carnal, I said that I wanted</p>
      <br>
      <p>to be thrust and shuddered</p>
      <p>under any him willing to be violent</p>
      <br>
      <p>as a god. I said that I wanted to</p>
      <p>understand the point and the hilt</p>
      <br>
      <p>of the sword, I wanted to know</p>
      <p>life gorged and garnet as</p>
      <br>
      <p>the howl inside of every red.</p>
      <p>I tasted fang and honey heavy</p>
      <br>
      <p>as hatred, I tasted tongue, I wanted</p>
      <p>this ragged with waiting, with shame.</p>
