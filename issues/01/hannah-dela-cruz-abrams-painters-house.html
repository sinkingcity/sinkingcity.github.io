			<p><i>for Sully</i></p>
			<br>
			<p>In the painter’s house, we begin</p>
			<p>with bourbon, our hair glued with bits of paper.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Orion hangs from every ceiling.</p>
			<p>We bang our heads on clotheslines of drying stars.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The painter is making art from toilet paper</p>
			<p>rolls and singing The Ways of Man. I am</p>
			<br>
			<p>smacking mosquitoes from my forehead</p>
			<p>and announcing that in Ancient Egypt</p>
			<br>
			<p>the stars of Orion were the god Sah.</p>
			<p>With some violence, the painter says,</p>
			<br>
			<p><i>Did you know I have a thing about holes.</i> Tiny</p>
			<p>holes. Things are not going the way we planned.</p>
			<br>
			<p>The painter’s two pigs sleep side by side</p>
			<p>under the desk. The cat, who has walked</p>
			<br>
			<p>across the palette, snores with rainbow</p>
			<p>feet. Upstairs the bunnies are mating.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Our ideas have run out and must be cut</p>
			<p>with exacto knives from catalogues and taped</p>
			<br>
			<p>to our legs. The floor is littered now</p>
			<p>with everything we hate, which is more and more,</p>
			<br>
			<p>and no one we love calls back, which is truer and truer.</p>
			<p>Let me tell you, sometimes tiredness feels like despair,</p>
			<br>
			<p>and other times it can feel like gladdening.</p>
			<p>In this endless night, we are bourbon-ing,</p>
			<br>
			<p>now taller than the sky, its watercolor stars,</p>
			<p>its sheaves of gold hunters. Ink on our feet, ink in our teeth.</p>
			<br>
			<p>I once had a dream that when I wrote, my hair would grow</p>
			<p>and grow. Two small children stood behind me</p>
			<br>
			<p>with giant scissors to chop it short</p>
			<p>while I typed. That is was tonight feels like.</p>
			<br>
			<p>Like our hair is growing long. In the painter’s house,</p>
			<p>we begin and stay and stay without ending.</p>
			<br>
			<p>All the animals are awake and cheering.</p>
			<p>The painter calls, <i>Give me an image</i>—</p>

			While pursuing art at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a concentration on metal sculpture, Sullivan Elaine Anlyan strayed from her studies and realized her true creative passion was in drawing. Her work is a combination of pen and ink and paint on canvas, with backgrounds using metal leaf gilding. Following her love and passion, she has focused heavily on animal imagery and sees her work as a study of the iconography of nature.
