    <div class="poem-content">
      <p>I think maybe you’re like the earring</p>
      <p>I left at another man’s apartment.</p>
      <p>The gold one, knotted like knuckles</p>
      <p>looking for each other, the one my mother</p>
      <p>told me do not lose this, you know the one.</p>
      <p>You’re like it because somehow I’m not convinced</p>
      <p>it’s gone.</p>
      <p>No, it’s just at the bottom of my purse</p>
      <p>or in a misguided pocket</p>
      <p>or maybe the back of your throat.</p>
      <p>Stuck where the <i>move to California</i></p>
      <p>should’ve been, growing mossy and ever-itchy—</p>
      <p>do you feel it? Embedded in your Adam’s apple.</p>
      <p>It’s like that.</p>
      <p>Like the feeling of trying to run</p>
      <p>but you can’t get past that first catch in your ankles.</p>
      <p>Like that.</p>
      <p>It’s like this man’s breath on my neck when all I can think about</p>
      <p>is how I can’t believe I asked you to hold</p>
      <p>my subway pass and debit card and my goddamn Chanel lipstick</p>
      <p>and expected you not to lose them all.</p>
      <p>Like that.</p>
      <p>It’s like laying on the dock and feeling the sun</p>
      <p>pop each dusty skin cell into something I wish you would miss.</p>
      <p>Like that.</p>
      <p>It’s like that.</p>
      <p>It’s like taking a shower, but the shower curtain is missing</p>
      <p>nd the air is cold and there’s too much water on the floor</p>
      <p>so I sit down.</p>
      <p>It’s like that.</p>
      <p>Like me reaching up to my earlobe, blank</p>
      <p>and thinking of you.</p>
