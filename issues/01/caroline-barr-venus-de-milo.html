			<p>You can open me. Unwrap</p>
			<p>these sheets and pull—just</p>
			<p>slowly, though, and lick your</p>
			<p>fingers first—pull my left</p>
			<p>breast out and find the note</p>
			<p>you wrote to your kindergarten</p>
			<p>love. All x’s and o’s and crayon</p>
			<p>devotion. Reach further, the tube</p>
			<p>of lipstick your babysitter forgot</p>
			<p>in the couch cushions has rolled</p>
			<p>to the back. Remember how she</p>
			<p>taught you spin-the-bottle?</p>
			<p>With those dark berry lips. Now,</p>
			<p>move your hand to my knee, spilling</p>
			<p>over with the coarse-ground grits</p>
			<p>you knelt on for ten whole minutes</p>
			<p>when your mother caught you</p>
			<p>watching porn. You couldn’t even pull</p>
			<p>up your boxers first. Scoop them out</p>
			<p>and find the broken condom. The back-seat</p>
			<p>night that almost made you a man</p>
			<p>too soon. This is what built you, these</p>
			<p>wide-eyed nights stinging red like a fresh</p>
			<p>tattoo only I can see. Here, kiss me.</p>
			<p>Rest your head on my ribs. I am not afraid</p>
			<p>of knowing you.</p>
